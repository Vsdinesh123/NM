# NM_Driver_Exploration_And_Predition_of_company_Registratin_Trends_with_Registrar_of_Companies-ROC
AI-Driven Exploration and Prediction of Company Registration Trends
This repository contains code for an AI project aimed at exploring historical company registration trends,
developing predictive models, and enabling informed decision-making using data from the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

Project Overview:
The project is divided into multiple phases:

Ideation Phase: Defined the problem and objectives of the project.

Design and Innovation Phase: Addressed data quality, feature engineering, machine learning model selection, real-time data integration, and ethical considerations.

Development Part 1: Started building the project by loading and preprocessing the dataset.

Development Part 2: Ongoing development involving exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

Code Structure
The code is structured into the following directories:

/data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
/src: Includes the source code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

Dependencies
The code relies on the following dependencies:

Python 3.6 or higher
Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
To install the necessary libraries, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
